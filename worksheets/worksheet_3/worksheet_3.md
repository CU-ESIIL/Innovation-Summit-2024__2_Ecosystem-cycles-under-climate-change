# TEAM ACTIVITY 2: Innovate as a Team

Welcome back! We hope today is a productive day getting to know your team and coding.

## Day 2 summary: 
Please complete the warm-up with your team, briefly review today’s objectives, and carefully read the Day 2 and Day 3 report out items to guide your efforts.  

## Objectives for Day 2
1. Work together to decide on the data sets you will use. Reminder: Use a decision-making technique discussed during Day 1. Kaner’s Gradient of Agreement is below for reference.
2. Practice joining your datasets together. 
3. Discuss and try creating interesting graphics.
4. Report back on your results at the end of the day. Today’s report back is short and focused on your team process. The Day 3 report back is more detailed. 


## Morning Warm-up
Please share the following informaton with your team. (No need to write down your responses this time)
- Name
- Pronouns
- Reflecting on Day 1, what is something that surprised you?

## Decision-Making
Use the gradient of agreement (Kaner 20214) to make decisions as a team.

## Day 2 Report Back
Day 2 report-back questions are about the team *process*. We are interested in your team’s unique experience. Below are some prompts you might consider. You don't need to address all of them - choose which ones you want to present. Please limit your reflection to 2-3 mins.  

1. **What worked well for your team?** We clarified our question.
2. **What’s one thing you would change?** We wish we had more time to get our datasets together. 
3. **Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment?  What led up to that moment?** We sketched out our first outcome figure.
4. **Did your group experience the groan zone?  What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?** Yes, early on day two we ended up growing the list of idead instead of narrowing them down. We overcame it with a combination of humor, straw polls, going back to the report back prompts, and the tyranny of will.

**************************************************************

### Looking Ahead: Day 3 Report Back
*These are the prompts for the final Report Back **tomorrow (Day 3)** - start thinking about these questions as you work today. Each group will share their Day 3 GitHub page on the screen and give a 4 minute presentation.*

- **Project Title:**: "Changes in species interactions under global change"
- **Research Question:** How species iteractions change given extream events while accounting for global change (change in phenology, range shifts, ext)
- **One interesting graphic/finding:**
- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
  - Abstract? Workshop Proposal? Potentially starting with GBIF, Identify LTER/NEON dataset to use.
- **What’s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
   - OneHealth approach
   - Disease modeling expertise
   - Expertise in working with detection probability problems.
      
### Reminder
There is the opportunity for groups to continue working on their projects as an ESIIL Working Group. If you love your team and want to continue working together, considering submitting a Working Group Application this fall. See the ESIIL website for more information: <https://esiil.org/working-groups>.
