By defining neighborhood boundaries through redlining, HOLC maps not only mirrored societal biases but also perpetuated and embedded them into the urban landscape.

If you\u2019re fluent in one of these languages but hesitant to learn the other, you\u2019re in the right place. The good news is that there are many similarities between R and Python that make it easy to switch between the two.</p> <p>Both R and Python are widely used in data science and are open-source, meaning that they are free to use and constantly being improved by the community. They both have extensive libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. In fact, many of the libraries in both languages have similar names and functions, such as Pandas in Python and data.table in R.</p> <p>While there are differences between the two languages, they can complement each other well. Python is versatile and scalable, making it ideal for large and complex projects such as web development and artificial intelligence. R, on the other hand, is known for its exceptional statistical capabilities and is often used in data analysis and modeling. Visualization is also easier in R, making it a popular choice for creating graphs and charts.</p> <p>By learning both R and Python, you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the strengths of each language and create more efficient and robust data analysis workflows. Don\u2019t let the differences between the two languages intimidate you - once you become familiar with one, learning the other will be much easier.</p> <p>So, whether you\u2019re a Python enthusiast looking to expand your statistical analysis capabilities, or an R user interested in exploring the world of web development and artificial intelligence, this guide will help you become bilingual in R and Python.</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/bilingualism_md/#install-packages","title":"Install packages","text":"<p>In R, packages can be installed from CRAN repository by using the install.packages() function:</p> <p>R code:</p> <pre><code># Install the dplyr package from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n</code></pre> <p>In Python, packages can be installed from the Anaconda repository by using the conda install command:</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code># Install the pandas package from Anaconda\n!conda install pandas\n</code></pre> <p>Loading libraries in R and Python</p> <p>In R, libraries can be loaded in the same way as before, using the library() function:</p> <p>R code:</p> <pre><code># Load the dplyr library\nlibrary(dplyr)\n</code></pre> <p>In Python, libraries can be loaded in the same way as before, using the import statement.

We then generate a list of numbers from 1 to 10. We then use the plan function to set the parallelization strategy to \u201cmultisession\u201d, which will use multiple CPU cores to execute the code. Finally, we use the future_map function from furrr to apply the function x^2 to each number in the list in parallel.</p> <p>Parallel computing in Python In Python, the standard library includes the multiprocessing module, which provides basic support for parallel computing. Additionally, there are several third-party packages that provide higher-level abstractions, such as joblib and dask.</p> <p>Here is an example of using the multiprocessing module to execute a loop in parallel:</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code>def square(x):\n    return x**2\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\n# Generate a list of numbers\nnumbers = list(range(1, 11))\n\n# Use the map function and a pool of workers to parallelize the square function\nwith Pool() as pool:\n    squares = pool.map(square, numbers)\n\nprint(squares)\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, we define a function myfunc() that takes an input x and returns x^2. We generate some data mydata and use the Pool class from the multiprocessing module to set up a pool of 4 workers. We then use the map() method of the Pool class to apply myfunc() to each element of mydata in parallel.</p> <p>Comparison and contrast Both R and Python have built-in support for parallel computing, with similar basic functionality for creating and managing parallel processes. However, the higher-level abstractions differ between the two languages. In R, the foreach package provides a high-level interface that makes it easy to write parallel code, while in Python, the multiprocessing module provides a basic interface that can be extended using third-party packages like joblib and dask.</p> <p>Additionally, Python has better support for distributed computing using frameworks like Apache Spark, while R has better support for shared-memory parallelism using tools like data.table and ff.</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/bilingualism_md/#data-wrangling","title":"Data wrangling","text":"<p>Data wrangling is an important part of any data analysis project, and both R and Python provide tools and libraries for performing this task. In this answer, we will compare and contrast data wrangling in R\u2019s tidyverse and Python\u2019s pandas library, with working examples in code.</p> <p>Data Wrangling in R Tidyverse</p> <p>The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science, and it includes several packages that are useful for data wrangling. One of the most popular packages is dplyr, which provides a grammar of data manipulation for data frames.</p> <p>Here is an example of using dplyr to filter, mutate, and summarize a data frame:</p> <p>R code</p> <pre><code>library(dplyr)\n\n# Load data\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# Filter for cars with more than 100 horsepower\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  filter(hp &gt; 100) %&gt;%\n  # Add a new column with fuel efficiency in km per liter\n  mutate(kmpl = 0.425 * mpg) %&gt;%\n  # Group by number of cylinders and summarize\n  group_by(cyl) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_hp = mean(hp),\n            mean_kmpl = mean(kmpl))\n</code></pre> <pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 \u00d7 3\n##     cyl mean_hp mean_kmpl\n##   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1     4    111      11.0 \n## 2     6    122.      8.39\n## 3     8    209.      6.42\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, we first filter the mtcars data frame to only include cars with more than 100 horsepower. We then use mutate to create a new column with fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter. Finally, we group the data by the number of cylinders and calculate the mean horsepower and fuel efficiency.</p> <p>Data Wrangling in Python Pandas</p> <p>Pandas is a popular library for data manipulation in Python. It provides a data frame object similar to R\u2019s data frames, along with a wide range of functions for data wrangling.</p> <p>Here is an example of using pandas to filter, transform, and group a data frame:</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code>import pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\nmtcars = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mtcars.csv')\n\n# Filter for cars with more than 100 horsepower\nfiltered_mtcars = mtcars[mtcars['hp'] &gt; 100]\n\n# Add a new column with fuel efficiency in km per liter\nfiltered_mtcars['kmpl'] = 0.425 * filtered_mtcars['mpg']\n\n# Group by number of cylinders and calculate mean horsepower and fuel efficiency\ngrouped_mtcars = filtered_mtcars.groupby('cyl').agg({'hp': 'mean',\n                                                     'kmpl': 'mean'})\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, we first load the mtcars data from a CSV file. We then filter the data to only include cars with more than 100 horsepower, using boolean indexing. We use the assign function to create a new column with fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter. Finally, we group the data by the number of cylinders and calculate the mean horsepower and fuel efficiency.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>Overall, both R\u2019s tidyverse and Python\u2019s pandas provide similar functionality for data wrangling. Both allow for filtering, transforming, and aggregating data frames. The syntax for performing these operations is slightly different between the two languages, with R using the %&gt;% operator for chaining operations and Python using method chaining or the apply family of functions.</p> <p>One key difference between the two languages is that R\u2019s tidyverse provides a consistent grammar for data manipulation across its various packages, making it easier to learn and use. However, Python\u2019s pandas library has a larger developer community and is more versatile for use in other applications, such as web development or machine learning.</p> <p>In conclusion, both R and Python provide powerful tools for data wrangling, and the choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific needs of the user and their familiarity</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/bilingualism_md/#data-from-api","title":"Data from API","text":"<p>Retrieving data from an API is a common task in both R and Python.

Here, the data cube creator, much like Adams with his careful dodging and burning, harmonizes disparate elements into a cohesive whole, each decision reflecting an intention and vision for the final product.</p>"},{"location":"data-library/stac_mount_save/#1-the-rat-through-the-snake-problem-scalability-with-cloud-computing","title":"1) The Rat through the Snake Problem: Scalability with Cloud Computing","text":"<p>Just like a snake that swallows a rat, traditional computing systems often struggle to process the large volumes of environmental data \u2014 they\u2019re constrained by their static hardware limitations.

Art that integrates with and elevates our daily surroundings could offer a fresh perspective on the mundane.</p> <p>Nature in the Workplace: On a personal note, I find that art which brings elements of the outdoors inside can create a serene and motivating atmosphere, conducive to the values of sustainability that ESIIL embodies.</p> <p>Interactive Art: I believe that art installations which invite interaction or present a playful exaggeration of reality can energize our space. They have the potential to foster a creative dialogue among the team and with visitors.</p> <p>Dimensionality and Engagement: From my viewpoint, art that breaks out of the traditional two-dimensional space and engages with the viewer in three dimensions can transform the feel of an office. Such dynamic pieces could encourage innovative thinking and collaboration.</p> <p>Art with a Message: It\u2019s my opinion that the art we choose should subtly reflect our collective social and environmental commitments. Pieces that prompt introspection about our role in larger societal issues could resonate well with our team\u2019s ethos.</p> <p>Community Connection: Lastly, I feel that our office should not just be a place for work but also a space that invites community interaction. Art can be a bridge between ESIIL and the public, making our office a hub for inspiration and engagement.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"resources/citations/","title":"Citation Management and Notes Collection in Markdown","text":""},{"location":"resources/citations/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This document serves as a guide for managing citations and collecting research notes for our project.
